# chess-game

I enjoy chess and wanted to do something in C++ (sounds like a good motivation). So, this is an implementation of a chess game with GUI in C++. The interface was built using the SFML graphics library.  
<br>
This implementation includes the basic game rules and moves implemented from scratch. Some important parts are still missing but I intend to implement them in the future.  
### Main ToDos:
* drag and drop pieces
* side pawn capture
* promote pawns
* block moves when king is attacked
* end game in checkmate
